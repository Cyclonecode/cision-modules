This plugin aims to add support for different cision modules.

== Description ==

This plugin can be used to display tickers from Cision.

= Shortcode =

The shortcode **[cision-ticker]** can either be used by adding it to the content field of any post or by using the **do_shortcode** function in one of your templates.
At the moment the shortcode will only render the associated label with price and currency for each ticker.

If there is other data that you need to display, please contact me and perhaps we can make a small addition for this.
